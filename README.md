After creating the user interface, we store the questions into an array. The questions array contains 10 objects, each composed of a question string and an array of choices. The choices array contains 4 objects, each having an option property and a property named correct which is a boolean(true for the right option and false otherwise). We then select the relevant elements in the DOM and save them in aptly-named variables. We use event delegation to add an event listener on the parent container of the options. We create the functions loadQuestions and selectAnswer that does exactly what their name implies. We add event listeners on the submit and restart buttons that listens for clicks and then runs the corresponding functions(submitQuiz and restartQuiz). Finally, we call the loadQuestion function and our beautiful Quiz begins.
